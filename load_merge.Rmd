# Merging the original datafiles


**This is no longer updated as I'm doing the data conversions from .csv to .RData within `createRData`-project under `eusilc/dataOperations`.

******

1. Reading the original .csv files
2. merging the at the
    - household level
    - individual level
    - merging the household data with individual level data
3. saving the merged data files as
    - `hh_merge.RData`
    - `per_merge.RData`
    - `merge.RData`
